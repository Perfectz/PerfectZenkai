## üî¨ TDD Plan (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)

### RED Phase - Failing Tests First
```typescript
// 1. Workout Planning Tests
describe('WorkoutPlanningAgent', () => {
  test('should generate personalized workout plans', () => {
    // Should fail - workout planning agent doesn't exist yet
  })
  
  test('should adapt plans based on user equipment and time', () => {
    // Should fail - adaptive planning not implemented
  })
})

// 2. Progress Tracking Tests
describe('FitnessProgressAgent', () => {
  test('should track exercise progression over time', () => {
    // Should fail - progress tracking not implemented
  })
  
  test('should identify strength and endurance improvements', () => {
    // Should fail - fitness analytics not implemented
  })
})

// 3. Coaching Intelligence Tests
describe('FitnessCoachingAgent', () => {
  test('should provide exercise form guidance', () => {
    // Should fail - coaching intelligence not implemented
  })
  
  test('should suggest workout modifications for safety', () => {
    // Should fail - safety recommendations not implemented
  })
})
```

### GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation
1. **Workout Planning Agent**: Basic exercise routine generation
2. **Progress Tracking Agent**: Simple workout logging and basic analytics
3. **Coaching Agent**: Exercise database with form tips and safety guidelines
4. **Chat Integration**: Natural language fitness queries and coaching

### REFACTOR Phase - Polish & Optimize
1. **Advanced Planning**: Machine learning-based workout personalization
2. **Sophisticated Analytics**: Comprehensive fitness progress insights
3. **Intelligent Coaching**: Context-aware form guidance and injury prevention
4. **Gamification**: Achievement systems, challenges, and social features

## üìÖ Timeline & Effort
| Day | Task | Owner |
|-----|------|-------|
| 1 | MVP doc, failing tests (RED), workout planning foundation | Dev A |
| 2 | Progress tracking and coaching agents (GREEN) | Dev B |
| 3 | Chat integration and natural language processing | Dev A |
