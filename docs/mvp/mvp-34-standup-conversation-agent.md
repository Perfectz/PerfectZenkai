# MVP-34 ‚Äì Standup Conversation Agent

## üìú Problem Statement
Users need an efficient, conversational way to conduct daily standup check-ins (morning planning and nightly reviews) that feels natural and captures comprehensive information without manual typing. A **Standup Conversation Agent** with text-to-speech capabilities can conduct interactive voice conversations to gather standup information, provide insights, and maintain consistency in daily reporting.

*Current Pain Points*
- Manual standup reporting is time-consuming and often skipped
- No structured conversational interface for daily check-ins
- Lack of voice interaction makes standup feel like a chore
- Missing integration between morning planning and nightly reviews
- No intelligent follow-up questions or contextual prompts

## üéØ Goal
Deliver an intelligent **Standup Conversation Agent** that conducts natural voice conversations for morning planning and nightly reviews, automatically captures standup data, provides intelligent insights, and maintains conversational context across daily check-ins.

*Success Criteria*
1. **Voice Conversation Interface**: Natural speech-to-text and text-to-speech interaction
2. **Morning Standup Flow**: Interactive morning planning with goal setting and priority identification
3. **Nightly Review Flow**: Comprehensive evening reflection with accomplishment tracking
4. **Intelligent Prompting**: Context-aware follow-up questions and suggestions
5. **Cross-Module Integration**: Pull insights from tasks, goals, and other modules
6. **Conversation Memory**: Maintain context across multiple exchanges and days

## üî¨ TDD Plan (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)

### RED Phase - Failing Tests First
```typescript
// 1. Voice Interface Tests
describe('VoiceConversationAgent', () => {
  test('should handle speech-to-text input', () => {
    // Should fail - voice interface doesn't exist yet
  })
  
  test('should provide text-to-speech output', () => {
    // Should fail - speech synthesis not implemented
  })
})

// 2. Morning Standup Tests
describe('MorningStandupAgent', () => {
  test('should conduct structured morning planning conversation', () => {
    // Should fail - morning standup flow not implemented
  })
  
  test('should integrate with tasks and goals for daily planning', () => {
    // Should fail - cross-module integration not implemented
  })
})

// 3. Nightly Review Tests
describe('NightlyReviewAgent', () => {
  test('should conduct comprehensive evening reflection', () => {
    // Should fail - nightly review flow not implemented
  })
  
  test('should track accomplishments and challenges', () => {
    // Should fail - reflection tracking not implemented
  })
})
```

### GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation
1. **Voice Interface Agent**: Basic speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities
2. **Morning Standup Agent**: Simple morning planning conversation flow
3. **Nightly Review Agent**: Basic evening reflection conversation
4. **Conversation Engine**: Context-aware prompting and conversation management

### REFACTOR Phase - Polish & Optimize
1. **Advanced Voice Processing**: Improved speech recognition accuracy and natural synthesis
2. **Intelligent Conversations**: Context-aware follow-ups and personalized prompting
3. **Deep Integration**: Rich cross-module data integration and insights
4. **Conversation Analytics**: Standup trend analysis and improvement suggestions

## üìÖ Timeline & Effort
| Day | Task | Owner |
|-----|------|-------|
| 1 | MVP doc, failing tests (RED), voice interface foundation | Dev A |
| 2 | Morning and nightly standup flows (GREEN) | Dev B |
| 3 | Conversation intelligence and cross-module integration | Dev A |
| 4 | Advanced voice processing and analytics (REFACTOR) | Dev B |

_Total effort_: ~2 engineer-days.
