## 🏗️ Design Decisions

### Architecture Strategy

**Decision 1: Vite over Create React App**
- **Problem:** Need fast development server with modern tooling
- **Solution:** Vite with React and TypeScript template
- **Alternatives Considered:** CRA, Webpack, Parcel
- **Rationale:** Better performance, faster HMR, modern ESM support
- **Test Impact:** Requires Vite-specific testing configuration

**Decision 2: Modular Folder Structure**
- **Problem:** Prevent tight coupling and enforce separation of concerns
- **Solution:** Feature-based modules with shared utilities
- **Trade-offs:** Initial complexity vs. long-term maintainability
- **Future Impact:** Enables independent feature development

### Technology Choices

**Decision 3: shadcn/ui over Material-UI**
- **Problem:** Need customizable, modern UI components
- **Solution:** shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS integration
- **Alternatives Considered:** Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI
- **Rationale:** Better customization, smaller bundle, Tailwind synergy
- **Test Impact:** Requires component library testing patterns

**Decision 4: Dark Theme Default**
- **Problem:** Provide modern, comfortable user experience
- **Solution:** Dark theme as default with system preference detection
- **Rationale:** Better for daily use, modern aesthetic, battery savings
- **Future Impact:** Establishes design system foundation
