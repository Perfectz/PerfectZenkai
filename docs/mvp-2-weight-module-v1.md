## 🏗️ Design Decisions

### Architecture Strategy

**Decision 1: Zustand + Dexie for State Management**
- **Problem:** Need offline-first data persistence with reactive UI updates
- **Solution:** Zustand for state management, Dexie for IndexedDB operations
- **Alternatives Considered:** Redux + RTK Query, Jotai + localForage
- **Rationale:** Simpler API, better TypeScript support, excellent offline capabilities
- **Test Impact:** Requires testing both store and database layers

**Decision 2: Module Isolation Pattern**
- **Problem:** Prevent tight coupling between weight and other features
- **Solution:** Complete module isolation with no cross-imports
- **Trade-offs:** Some code duplication vs. maintainability
- **Future Impact:** Enables independent feature development and testing

### Technology Choices

**Decision 3: react-swipeable for Touch Interactions**
- **Problem:** Need reliable touch gestures for mobile UX
- **Solution:** react-swipeable library for swipe and long-press detection
- **Alternatives Considered:** Native touch events, react-use-gesture
- **Rationale:** Mature library, good mobile support, simple API
- **Test Impact:** Requires specialized touch interaction testing

**Decision 4: shadcn Sheet for Add Weight UI**
- **Problem:** Need mobile-optimized modal for weight entry
- **Solution:** shadcn Sheet component with form integration
- **Rationale:** Consistent with design system, mobile-optimized, accessible
- **Future Impact:** Establishes pattern for other feature modals
