Perfect Zenkai is built using **Vertical Slice Architecture** with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and type safety.

### 🧱 **Technology Stack**

#### **Frontend**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design tokens for consistent UI
- **Zustand** for lightweight, scalable state management
- **Dexie.js** for offline-first IndexedDB data persistence

#### **Backend & Data**
- **Supabase** for real-time database, authentication, and storage
- **Azure Functions** for serverless API endpoints and secret management
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for AI chat, insights, and function calling
- **Azure Key Vault** for secure credential management

#### **PWA & Performance**
- **Service Worker** for offline functionality and caching
- **Web App Manifest** for native app-like experience
- **Workbox** for advanced caching strategies
- **Lighthouse Score 90+** for optimal performance

### 🏛️ **Architectural Principles**

#### **1. Vertical Slice Architecture**
Each feature is implemented as a complete vertical slice:

```
Feature Slice:
├── 🎨 UI Layer (React components)
├── 🧠 Business Logic (hooks, services)
├── 💾 Data Layer (stores, API calls)
├── 🔧 Type Safety (TypeScript interfaces)
└── 🧪 Test Coverage (all layers tested)
```

#### **2. Module Structure**
```
src/modules/[feature]/
├── components/          # UI components
├── hooks/              # Business logic hooks
├── services/           # Data services & AI agents
├── stores/             # State management
├── types/              # TypeScript definitions
├── pages/              # Route components
├── __tests__/          # Comprehensive test suites
└── index.ts            # Public API
```

#### **3. AI Agent Architecture**
Each domain has specialized AI agents:

- **TaskProductivityAgent** - Task analysis and optimization
- **WeightManagementAgent** - Health insights and coaching
- **JournalWellnessAgent** - Mental health support and analysis
- **FoodAnalysisAgent** - Nutrition analysis and meal planning

#### **4. Data Flow**
```
User Input → AI Chat Interface → Function Registry → Domain Agents → Data Stores → UI Updates
```
