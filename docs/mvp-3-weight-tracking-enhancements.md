## 🏗️ Design Decisions

### Architecture Strategy

**Decision 1: Inline Form over Modal**
- **Problem:** FAB + bottom sheet creates friction in daily logging
- **Solution:** Always-visible inline form with progressive disclosure
- **Alternatives Considered:** Improved modal, slide-in panel, floating form
- **Rationale:** Reduces cognitive load, follows todo page patterns
- **Test Impact:** Simplified interaction testing, no modal state management

**Decision 2: Real-time Analytics**
- **Problem:** Users want immediate feedback on progress
- **Solution:** Analytics dashboard updates instantly after weight entry
- **Trade-offs:** Increased computation vs. better user experience
- **Future Impact:** Enables more sophisticated analytics features

### Technology Choices

**Decision 3: Component-based Analytics**
- **Problem:** Need flexible, reusable analytics displays
- **Solution:** Modular WeightAnalytics component with props configuration
- **Alternatives Considered:** Single monolithic dashboard, chart library
- **Rationale:** Better maintainability, easier testing, performance control
- **Test Impact:** Isolated component testing, easier mocking

**Decision 4: Progressive Disclosure Pattern**
- **Problem:** Advanced features shouldn't overwhelm simple use cases
- **Solution:** Expandable sections for date picker and advanced options
- **Rationale:** Maintains simplicity while providing power user features
- **Future Impact:** Pattern can be extended to other complex forms
