- **Solution:** Vitest with native ESM and TypeScript support
- **Alternatives Considered:** Jest, Mocha, Jasmine
- **Rationale:** Better Vite integration, faster execution, modern features
- **Test Impact:** Native TypeScript support reduces configuration complexity

**Decision 2: Playwright over Cypress**
- **Problem:** Need reliable E2E testing with mobile device simulation
- **Solution:** Playwright with multi-browser and mobile testing capabilities
- **Trade-offs:** Learning curve vs. comprehensive testing capabilities
- **Future Impact:** Enables comprehensive cross-browser and mobile testing

### Technology Choices

**Decision 3: React Testing Library Integration**
- **Problem:** Need component testing that follows best practices
- **Solution:** React Testing Library with custom utilities
- **Alternatives Considered:** Enzyme, native React test utils
- **Rationale:** Encourages accessible testing patterns, community standard
- **Test Impact:** Promotes testing user behavior over implementation details

**Decision 4: MSW for API Mocking**
- **Problem:** Need reliable API mocking for integration tests
- **Solution:** Mock Service Worker for request interception
- **Rationale:** Works in both browser and Node.js, realistic mocking
- **Future Impact:** Enables comprehensive API testing patterns
