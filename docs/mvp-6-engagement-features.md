## üéØ User Stories & Tasks

### 6.1 Daily Reminder

**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Story Points:** 4  
**Status:** üî¥ Not Started

**User Story:** _As a user, I get reminded to track my weight daily._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] At 9 AM if no weight logged today, push notification "Time to weigh in"
- [ ] Requests notification permission on first /weight visit
- [ ] Respects user's notification preferences
- [ ] Notification click opens /weight route
- [ ] Smart scheduling (no weekends, holidays optional)

**Technical Details:**

```typescript
// Notification logic
- Check if weight logged today
- Schedule next 9 AM reminder
- Handle permission states
- Deep link to weight page
- Respect user preferences
```

**Implementation Prompt:**

```
Update service worker (sw.ts) to add:
- scheduleDailyReminder() function using setTimeout until next 9am
- Check if weight logged today before sending notification
- Notification payload: "Time to weigh in" with Perfect Zenkai icon

Add notification permission request to WeightPage on first visit.

Handle notification click to open /weight route.
```

**Test-Code Prompt:**

```
Create e2e/PushReminder.e2e.ts that:
- Mocks service worker push event
- Triggers daily reminder logic
- Asserts notification payload contains correct text
- Tests notification click behavior
- Verifies permission request flow
```

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Notifications sent at correct time
- [ ] Permission flow works
- [ ] Click navigation works
- [ ] No spam (respects user choice)

### 6.2 Custom Install Prompt

**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Status:** üî¥ Not Started

**User Story:** _As a user, I'm prompted to install the app at the right time._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] After 30s of first visit, Sheet asks to install
- [ ] "Install" button calls `event.prompt()`
- [ ] "Later" button remembers choice in localStorage
- [ ] Doesn't show again if previously declined
- [ ] Respects browser install criteria

**UX Flow:**

```
First Visit ‚Üí 30s delay ‚Üí Install Sheet
‚îú‚îÄ Install ‚Üí Browser install flow
‚îî‚îÄ Later ‚Üí Remember choice, don't show again

Return Visit ‚Üí Check localStorage ‚Üí No prompt if declined
```

**Implementation Prompt:**

```
Create src/shared/hooks/useDeferredInstallPrompt.ts that:
- Captures beforeinstallprompt event
- Manages install prompt state
- Handles user choice persistence

Create src/app/components/InstallSheet.tsx with:
- shadcn Sheet component
- "Install Perfect Zenkai" title
- "Install" and "Later" buttons
- Auto-shows after 30s on first visit
- Respects previous "Later" choice

Add to AppShell.tsx with proper timing logic.
```

**Test-Code Prompt:**

```
Create e2e/InstallPrompt.e2e.ts that:
- Waits 35 seconds on first visit
- Expects InstallSheet to be visible
- Clicks "Later" button
- Reloads page
- Expects Sheet NOT to show again
- Tests "Install" button triggers prompt
```

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Timing works correctly
- [ ] User choice persisted
- [ ] Install flow works
- [ ] No repeated prompts

## üèóÔ∏è Design Decisions

### Notification Strategy

1. **9 AM timing**: Optimal for morning routine, not too early/late
2. **Conditional sending**: Only if no weight logged, prevents spam
3. **Permission on first use**: Context-aware, better acceptance rate
4. **Deep linking**: Direct to relevant page, better UX

### Install Prompt Strategy

1. **30-second delay**: User has time to evaluate app value
2. **First visit only**: Avoids annoying returning users
3. **Choice persistence**: Respects user decision
4. **Sheet UI**: Non-blocking, can be dismissed easily

### Technical Choices

1. **Service worker for notifications**: Reliable, works when app closed
2. **localStorage for preferences**: Simple, persistent, no server needed
3. **beforeinstallprompt**: Standard PWA install API
4. **Graceful degradation**: Works even if features not supported

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Sprint Velocity

- **Planned Story Points:** 7
- **Completed Story Points:** 7
- **Sprint Progress:** 100%

### Task Status

| Task                      | Status         | Assignee | Estimated Hours | Actual Hours |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------ |
