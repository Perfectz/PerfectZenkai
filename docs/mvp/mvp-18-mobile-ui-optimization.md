- 🔧 **Type Safety:** Mobile-specific TypeScript interfaces for responsive props
- 🧪 **Test Coverage:** Mobile responsiveness tests, touch interaction tests, viewport tests

## 🏗️ Design Decisions

### Architecture Strategy
**Decision 1: Mobile-First Responsive Design**
- **Problem:** Current UI elements don't properly scale for mobile devices, particularly Galaxy S24 Ultra
- **Solution:** Implement mobile-first CSS with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- **Alternatives Considered:** Desktop-first approach, separate mobile app
- **Rationale:** Mobile-first ensures optimal mobile experience while maintaining desktop compatibility
- **Test Impact:** Requires viewport-specific testing and responsive behavior validation

### Technology Choices
**Decision 2: CSS Custom Properties for Design Tokens**
- **Problem:** Inconsistent spacing and sizing across components
- **Solution:** Centralized design tokens using CSS custom properties
- **Trade-offs:** Initial setup time vs. long-term maintainability
- **Future Impact:** Enables easy theming and consistent design system
