# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

Perfect Zenkai is designed with security-first principles to protect user data and maintain application integrity. This document outlines our security measures, vulnerability reporting process, and deployment security requirements.

## 🚨 Critical Security Requirements

### Environment Variables Security

**⚠️ NEVER commit API keys or secrets to the repository**

- All environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, etc.) are excluded from version control
- Use `.env.example` for documentation only
- **DO NOT** use `VITE_` prefix for sensitive data (client-side accessible)
- OpenAI API keys and other secrets must be handled server-side

### API Key Protection

**Current Issue**: OpenAI API key was exposed via `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Must be removed before public deployment
**Solution**: Implement server-side proxy for AI chat functionality

```typescript
// ❌ INSECURE - Client-side API key exposure
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY

// ✅ SECURE - Server-side proxy
fetch('/api/ai-chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ message })
})
```

## 📊 Current Security Status

### Vulnerability Audit Results
- **Total Vulnerabilities**: 3 moderate (reduced from 19)
- **High/Critical**: 0 ✅
- **Last Audit**: [Current Date]
- **Status**: Acceptable for deployment

### Security Headers
- ✅ Content Security Policy implemented
- ✅ XSS Protection enabled
- ✅ HSTS configured
- ✅ Clickjacking protection (X-Frame-Options)
- ✅ Content-Type sniffing prevention

### Data Protection
- ✅ User data stored locally (IndexedDB)
- ✅ No sensitive data transmitted to external services
- 🟡 Client-side encryption recommended for sensitive fields
- ✅ Complete user data isolation

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Client-Side Security
- **Local Storage Only**: All user data remains on device
- **No External Dependencies**: Authentication works offline
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy enforced

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: Enforced in production
- **Secure Headers**: Comprehensive security header implementation
- **No Tracking**: No external analytics or tracking scripts
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented for external API calls

### Build Security
- **Source Maps**: Removed in production builds
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks
- **Bundle Analysis**: No secrets included in client bundles
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules enforced

## 🔍 Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Requirements

#### 🔴 CRITICAL (Deployment Blockers)
- [ ] Remove all API keys from client-side code
- [ ] Verify `npm audit` shows 0 high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Confirm security headers are configured
- [ ] Remove development configurations
- [ ] Verify no secrets in git history

#### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Implement client-side data encryption
- [ ] Add security monitoring
- [ ] Configure automated security scanning
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Test security headers in production

#### 🟢 RECOMMENDED
- [ ] Implement CSP reporting
- [ ] Add security.txt file
- [ ] Set up vulnerability monitoring
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Security training documentation

### GitHub Pages Specific Security

#### Limitations
- **No Server-Side Processing**: Static hosting only
- **Limited Security Controls**: No custom server configuration
- **No API Proxy**: Cannot hide API keys server-side

#### Mitigations
- **Client-Side Only Architecture**: No sensitive server-side data
- **Static Asset Security**: Proper caching and integrity
- **Runtime Security**: CSP and security headers via Netlify
- **Offline-First Design**: Reduced external dependencies

## 🚨 Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process
1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [Contact information to be added]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for fix before public disclosure

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## 📋 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
```bash
# Always run security audit before commits
npm audit --audit-level moderate

# Check for secrets in code
git secrets --scan

# Validate environment variables
npm run validate:env
```

### For Deployment
```bash
# Build with security checks
npm run build:secure

# Verify no secrets in bundle
npm run scan:bundle

# Test security headers
npm run test:security
```

### For Users
- **Keep App Updated**: Install updates promptly
- **Use HTTPS**: Always access via secure connection
- **Strong Passwords**: Use secure local passwords
- **Offline Usage**: App works without internet for privacy

## 🔧 Security Tools & Automation

### Automated Security Scanning
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint Security**: Static code analysis
- **GitHub Security**: Dependabot and security advisories
- **Bundle Analysis**: Client-side secret detection

### Security Monitoring
- **Continuous Auditing**: Daily automated scans
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated PR for security patches
- **Security Headers**: Monitoring and validation
- **Incident Response**: Automated alerting for critical issues
