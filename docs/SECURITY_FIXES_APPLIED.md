# Critical Security Fixes Applied - MVP 22

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities identified by Supabase linter and the fixes applied to resolve them.

## Security Issues Fixed

### 1. auth_users_exposed (ERROR - EXTERNAL)
**Issue**: View `user_lookup` in the public schema exposed `auth.users` data to anonymous roles.

**Risk**: High - Could expose sensitive user authentication data to unauthorized users.

**Fix Applied**:
- Recreated `user_lookup` view with proper access control
- Removed anonymous access completely
- Added authentication requirement (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
- Restricted to authenticated users only

### 2. security_definer_view (ERROR - EXTERNAL) 
**Issue**: Three views were defined with SECURITY DEFINER property:
- `public.user_lookup`
- `public.daily_points_stats` 
- `public.user_points_summary`

**Risk**: High - SECURITY DEFINER bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) and could expose data across user boundaries.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed SECURITY DEFINER from all views
- Added proper user-level filtering (user_id = auth.uid())
- Views now respect RLS policies automatically

### 3. rls_disabled_in_public (ERROR - EXTERNAL)
**Issue**: Two public tables had RLS disabled:
- `public.goals`
- `public.journal_entries`

**Risk**: Critical - Without RLS, users could access other users' private data.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enabled RLS on both tables
- Added `user_id` column to both tables with proper foreign key constraints
- Created comprehensive RLS policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Added indexes for performance optimization

## Migration Details

### File: `supabase/migrations/20250616000000_fix_critical_security_issues.sql`

**Database Changes**:
1. **user_lookup View**: Secured with authentication requirements
2. **Points Views**: Removed SECURITY DEFINER, added user filtering
3. **goals Table**: Added user_id column, enabled RLS, created policies
4. **journal_entries Table**: Added user_id column, enabled RLS, created policies
5. **Indexes**: Added performance indexes for new user_id columns

**RLS Policies Created**:
- Users can only view their own data
- Users can only insert data for themselves
- Users can only update their own data
- Users can only delete their own data

## Required Frontend Updates

### High Priority
1. **Authentication Service**: Update `user_lookup` usage in `src/modules/auth/services/supabaseAuth.ts`
2. **Journal Store**: Update to use async Supabase client in `src/modules/journal/store/index.ts`
3. **Goals Store**: Implement Supabase integration with user_id handling

### Medium Priority
1. **Test Updates**: Update tests to accommodate new RLS policies
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages for authentication failures

## Security Validation Steps

### To Apply the Migration:
1. Start Docker Desktop
2. Run: `npx supabase db reset`
3. Verify all migrations apply successfully
4. Test authentication flows
5. Verify data isolation between users

### To Verify Security:
1. Create multiple test users
2. Verify each user only sees their own data
3. Attempt to access other users' data (should fail)
4. Test anonymous access is properly blocked

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ Security Improvements
- **Complete data isolation** between users
- **No anonymous access** to sensitive data
- **Proper authentication** requirements enforced
- **RLS policies** protect all user data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Breaking Changes
- **Authentication required** for all data access
- **Frontend updates needed** for async Supabase client
- **Database schema changes** require migration

### üìã Next Steps
1. Apply the migration to development environment
2. Update frontend code to handle new security model
3. Test all user flows thoroughly
4. Apply to production after validation
