## 🏗️ Design Decisions

### Architecture Strategy

**Decision 1: Event-Driven Cross-Module Communication**
- **Problem:** Need dashboard to aggregate data without tight coupling
- **Solution:** Event-based subscription system for cross-module updates
- **Alternatives Considered:** Direct store imports, shared state management
- **Rationale:** Maintains module isolation while enabling data integration
- **Test Impact:** Requires testing event propagation and data consistency

**Decision 2: Dashboard as Aggregation Layer**
- **Problem:** Need unified view of user progress across features
- **Solution:** Dashboard module that computes analytics from other modules
- **Trade-offs:** Additional complexity vs. user value
- **Future Impact:** Establishes pattern for cross-module analytics

### Technology Choices

**Decision 3: Real-Time Updates with Store Subscriptions**
- **Problem:** Dashboard needs to reflect latest data immediately
- **Solution:** Zustand store subscriptions with efficient update propagation
- **Alternatives Considered:** Polling, manual refresh, WebSocket updates
- **Rationale:** Leverages existing store infrastructure, minimal overhead
- **Test Impact:** Requires testing subscription lifecycle and update timing

**Decision 4: Computed Analytics with Caching**
- **Problem:** Complex calculations could impact performance
- **Solution:** Computed properties with intelligent caching strategies
- **Rationale:** Balance between real-time updates and performance
- **Future Impact:** Enables more sophisticated analytics features
