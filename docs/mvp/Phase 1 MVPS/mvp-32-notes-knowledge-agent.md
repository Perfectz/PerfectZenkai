# MVP-32: Notes & Knowledge Agent

## üìú Problem Statement
Users accumulate vast amounts of notes and information but struggle with organization, retrieval, and knowledge synthesis. A **Notes & Knowledge Agent** can intelligently organize notes, extract key insights, create knowledge connections, and provide contextual information retrieval to transform scattered notes into actionable knowledge.

*Current Pain Points*
- Disorganized notes that are difficult to find and retrieve
- No intelligent tagging or categorization of note content
- Limited ability to connect related notes and extract patterns
- Lack of knowledge synthesis and insight generation
- No contextual search or semantic understanding of note content

## üéØ Goal
Deliver an intelligent **Notes & Knowledge Agent** that transforms note-taking into knowledge management through AI-powered organization, semantic search, insight extraction, and intelligent knowledge synthesis via natural language interactions.

*Success Criteria*
1. **Intelligent Organization**: AI-powered note categorization, tagging, and hierarchical structuring
2. **Semantic Search**: Advanced search capabilities that understand context and meaning
3. **Knowledge Extraction**: Identify key insights, patterns, and actionable information
4. **Connection Mapping**: Discover relationships between notes and create knowledge graphs
5. **Insight Generation**: Synthesize information across notes to generate new insights
6. **Contextual Retrieval**: Provide relevant notes based on current activities and goals

## üî¨ TDD Plan (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)

### RED Phase - Failing Tests First
```typescript
// 1. Smart Organization Tests
describe('NotesOrganizationAgent', () => {
  test('should automatically categorize and tag notes', () => {
    // Should fail - organization agent doesn't exist yet
  })
  
  test('should create hierarchical note structures', () => {
    // Should fail - hierarchical organization not implemented
  })
})

// 2. Semantic Search Tests
describe('SemanticSearchAgent', () => {
  test('should find notes by semantic meaning not just keywords', () => {
    // Should fail - semantic search not implemented
  })
  
  test('should provide contextual search results', () => {
    // Should fail - contextual search not implemented
  })
})

// 3. Knowledge Extraction Tests
describe('KnowledgeExtractionAgent', () => {
  test('should extract key insights from note collections', () => {
    // Should fail - knowledge extraction not implemented
  })
  
  test('should identify patterns across multiple notes', () => {
    // Should fail - pattern recognition not implemented
  })
})
```

### GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation
1. **Organization Agent**: Basic note categorization and tagging
