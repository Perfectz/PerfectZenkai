*Current Pain Points*
- Fragmented health data across multiple modules without holistic insights
- No correlation analysis between weight, nutrition, fitness, and mental wellness
- Limited predictive health analytics and trend forecasting
- Lack of personalized health recommendations based on comprehensive data
- No integration with external health data sources and wearable devices

## üéØ Goal
Deliver a comprehensive **Health Analytics Agent** that provides holistic health insights, cross-module correlation analysis, predictive health modeling, and personalized wellness recommendations through natural language interactions and integrated health data analysis.

*Success Criteria*
1. **Holistic Health Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of all health metrics and trends
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between weight, nutrition, fitness, and wellness
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast health trends and potential issues
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-driven health advice based on comprehensive data
5. **Risk Assessment**: Early warning systems for health concerns and goal deviations
6. **Integration Intelligence**: Connect data from all health modules and external sources

  test('should aggregate data from all health modules', () => {
    // Should fail - health analytics agent doesn't exist yet
  })
  
  test('should generate comprehensive health insights', () => {
    // Should fail - insight generation not implemented
  })
})

// 2. Correlation Engine Tests
describe('HealthCorrelationAgent', () => {
  test('should identify correlations between health metrics', () => {
    // Should fail - correlation analysis not implemented
  })
  
  test('should detect patterns across multiple health dimensions', () => {
