## 🏗️ Design Decisions

### Architecture Strategy

**Decision 1: Rich Text Storage Format**
- **Problem:** Need to store formatted text efficiently
- **Solution:** JSON-based rich text format with HTML fallback
- **Alternatives Considered:** HTML storage, Markdown, plain text
- **Rationale:** Structured, searchable, and editor-agnostic
- **Test Impact:** Requires serialization and format testing

**Decision 2: Client-Side Search Implementation**
- **Problem:** Need fast search without server dependency
- **Solution:** Client-side full-text search with indexing
- **Trade-offs:** Memory usage vs. search performance
- **Future Impact:** Enables offline search and instant results

### Technology Choices

**Decision 3: Tiptap for Rich Text Editing**
- **Problem:** Need powerful, extensible rich text editor
- **Solution:** Tiptap editor with custom extensions
- **Alternatives Considered:** Draft.js, Quill, custom editor
- **Rationale:** Modern, performant, and highly customizable
- **Test Impact:** Requires specialized editor testing approaches

**Decision 4: Fuse.js for Fuzzy Search**
- **Problem:** Need flexible search that handles typos
- **Solution:** Fuse.js for fuzzy search with custom scoring
- **Rationale:** Lightweight, fast, and configurable
- **Future Impact:** Establishes search patterns for other modules
