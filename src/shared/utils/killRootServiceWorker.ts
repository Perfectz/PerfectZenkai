// src/shared/utils/killRootServiceWorker.ts
// Utility to remove any old Service Worker that was registered with the
// root scope ("/"). Older builds of Perfect Zenkai may have registered a
// worker at scope `/`, which causes the installed PWA to launch at the
// repo root instead of the correct "/PerfectZenkai/" path.
//
// This helper is safe to call repeatedly. If no such registration exists
// nothing happens. We only run it in production so it never affects local
// development where the scope is "/" intentionally.
