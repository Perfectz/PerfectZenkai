## ðŸ”„ Enhanced Development Workflow

### Before Starting Any Task

```bash
# 1. Document Preparation
cp docs/mvp-template-standards.md docs/mvp-X-feature-name.md

# 2. Test Environment Setup
npm run test:setup-check
mkdir -p src/modules/[feature]/__tests__
touch e2e/[Feature].e2e.ts

# 3. Initial Documentation
# Update MVP document with TDD plan
# Set status to ðŸ”´ Not Started
```

### During TDD RED Phase

```bash
# 1. Write Failing Tests
npm run test:watch  # Continuous feedback

# 2. Document Test Plan
# Update MVP document with test specifications
# Set TDD Progress: RED âœ… | GREEN â­• | REFACTOR â­•

# 3. Verify Failures
npm run test src/modules/[feature] --reporter=verbose
```

### During TDD GREEN Phase

```bash
# 1. Minimal Implementation
npm run test:watch src/modules/[feature]

# 2. Integration Verification
npm run test --run

# 3. Progress Updates
# Set TDD Progress: RED âœ… | GREEN âœ… | REFACTOR â­•
```

### During TDD REFACTOR Phase

```bash
# 1. Quality Improvements
npm run test:coverage
npm run lint
npm run lighthouse

# 2. Documentation Updates
# Set TDD Progress: RED âœ… | GREEN âœ… | REFACTOR âœ…
# Update test metrics and coverage reports

# 3. Task Completion
# Set status to ðŸŸ¢ Completed
# Update solution design if needed
```

## ðŸ“ž Support & Questions

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to follow TDD for small changes?**
A: Yes, TDD approach applies to all feature development to maintain quality consistency.

**Q: What if tests are hard to write?**
A: Start with the simplest test case and gradually add complexity. Use the test-writing challenge as a design feedback mechanism.

**Q: How do I handle legacy code without tests?**
A: Add tests incrementally when modifying existing code, prioritizing high-risk areas first.

**Q: What if TDD slows down development?**
A: Initial setup takes longer, but overall development speed increases due to fewer bugs and easier refactoring.
