## üî¨ TDD Plan (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)

### RED Phase - Failing Tests First
```typescript
// 1. Goal Optimization Tests
describe('GoalOptimizationAgent', () => {
  test('should convert vague goals into SMART goals', () => {
    // Should fail - goal optimization agent doesn't exist yet
  })
  
  test('should suggest realistic timelines and milestones', () => {
    // Should fail - timeline optimization not implemented
  })
})

// 2. Progress Intelligence Tests
describe('ProgressIntelligenceAgent', () => {
  test('should track goal progress with predictive insights', () => {
    // Should fail - progress intelligence not implemented
  })
  
  test('should identify goal achievement bottlenecks', () => {
    // Should fail - bottleneck detection not implemented
  })
})

// 3. Motivation Coaching Tests
describe('MotivationCoachingAgent', () => {
  test('should provide personalized motivation strategies', () => {
    // Should fail - motivation coaching not implemented
  })
  
  test('should adapt encouragement based on user progress patterns', () => {
    // Should fail - adaptive motivation not implemented
  })
})
```

### GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation
1. **Goal Optimization Agent**: Basic SMART goal conversion and milestone planning
2. **Progress Intelligence Agent**: Simple progress tracking and completion estimation
3. **Motivation Coaching Agent**: Basic encouragement and accountability features
4. **Chat Integration**: Natural language goal management and coaching

### REFACTOR Phase - Polish & Optimize
1. **Advanced Optimization**: Machine learning-based goal personalization
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Sophisticated success probability modeling
3. **Behavioral Coaching**: Psychology-based motivation and habit formation
4. **Cross-Module Intelligence**: Deep integration with all life tracking modules

## üìÖ Timeline & Effort
| Day | Task | Owner |
|-----|------|-------|
| 1 | MVP doc, failing tests (RED), goal optimization foundation | Dev A |
| 2 | Progress intelligence and motivation coaching (GREEN) | Dev B |
| 3 | Chat integration and natural language processing | Dev A |
| 4 | Advanced analytics and cross-module integration (REFACTOR) | Dev B |

_Total effort_: ~2 engineer-days.
