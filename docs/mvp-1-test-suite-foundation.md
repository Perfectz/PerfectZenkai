## 🎯 User Stories & Tasks

### 1.1 Vitest Harness
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**User Story:** *As a developer, I can unit-test hooks & components easily with proper providers.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `src/test/setupTests.ts` registers RTL + jest-dom
- [x] `renderWithProviders()` helper adds MemoryRouter + Zustand + Dexie providers
- [x] Coverage gate ≥ 80% configured
- [x] JSDOM environment configured
- [x] Fast test execution (<5s for basic suite)

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
Create vitest.config.ts with:
- JSDOM environment
- Coverage threshold 80%
- setupFiles pointing to src/test/setupTests.ts

Create src/test/setupTests.ts importing @testing-library/jest-dom.

Implement renderWithProviders(children) wrapper that provides:
- MemoryRouter from react-router-dom
- Zustand store providers (when they exist)
- Any Dexie database providers
```

**Test-Code Prompt:**
```
Create src/test/Sample.test.tsx — render <button>Hi</button> with renderWithProviders and expect text "Hi" to be in document.
```

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] All tests pass with coverage infrastructure ready
- [x] renderWithProviders works with routing
- [x] Test execution is fast and reliable

### 1.2 Playwright Harness
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**User Story:** *As a developer, I can run e2e tests in mobile viewport automatically.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] playwright.config.ts default viewport 375×667 & baseURL=http://localhost:5173
- [x] `npm test:e2e` spins dev server automatically
- [x] Mobile-first testing approach
- [x] Screenshots on failure
- [x] Parallel test execution

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
Add @playwright/test dependency. Create playwright.config.ts with:
- Mobile viewport 375×667
- baseURL http://localhost:5173
- webServer config to start Vite dev server automatically
- Projects for chromium mobile

Add npm script "test:e2e": "playwright test"
```

**Test-Code Prompt:**
```
Create e2e/sample.spec.ts — goto '/', expect Header text "Perfect Zenkai", take screenshot sample.png.
```

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] E2E tests run reliably in mobile viewport
- [x] Dev server starts/stops automatically
- [x] Screenshots captured on failures

### 1.3 Lighthouse Gate
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**User Story:** *As a product owner, build fails if PWA score dips below 90.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `npm lighthouse` exits non-zero on < 90
- [x] Tests against production build
- [x] Detailed scoring breakdown
- [x] Performance budget enforcement

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
Create scripts/lighthouse.mjs that:
1. Runs `vite build && vite preview` 
2. Uses @lhci/cli with preset=pwa
3. Asserts PWA score ≥ 90
4. Exits with error code if fails

Add npm script "lighthouse": "node scripts/lighthouse.mjs"
```

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Lighthouse runs against production build
- [x] PWA score threshold enforced
- [x] Clear failure messages

---

### 1.4 CI Pipeline
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**User Story:** *As a team, all PRs run lint, unit, e2e, lighthouse automatically.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] GitHub Action passes on push/PR
- [x] Caches npm dependencies
- [x] Runs all quality gates
- [x] Fast feedback (<10 minutes)
- [x] Clear failure reporting

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
Create .github/workflows/ci.yml with:
- ubuntu-latest
- Node.js 18
- pnpm cache
- Steps: install, lint, test (with coverage), test:e2e, lighthouse
- Fail fast on any step failure
```

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] CI runs on every push/PR
- [x] All quality gates enforced
- [x] Build artifacts cached properly

## 🏗️ Design Decisions

### Testing Strategy
1. **Vitest over Jest**: Better Vite integration, faster execution, modern API
2. **Playwright over Cypress**: Better mobile testing, more reliable, faster
3. **RTL + jest-dom**: Industry standard for React component testing
4. **Coverage threshold 80%**: Balance between quality and development speed

### CI/CD Choices
1. **GitHub Actions**: Native integration, good performance, free for public repos
2. **pnpm caching**: Faster builds, consistent dependency resolution
3. **Fail-fast strategy**: Quick feedback, saves CI minutes
4. **Lighthouse CI**: Automated PWA quality enforcement

### Provider Pattern
1. **renderWithProviders**: Consistent test setup, reduces boilerplate
2. **Mock providers**: Isolated testing, predictable state
3. **Router integration**: Full navigation testing capability

- **CI setup complexity**: May need GitHub repository configuration

### Quality Gates
- [x] All unit tests pass with infrastructure ready
- [x] E2E tests pass in mobile viewport
- [x] Lighthouse PWA score ≥ 90 enforced
- [x] CI pipeline runs successfully

## 🔄 Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well
- Vitest configuration with coverage thresholds worked smoothly
- Playwright mobile-first approach implemented successfully
- CI pipeline covers all quality gates comprehensively
- renderWithProviders helper provides excellent testing foundation

### What Could Be Improved
- Coverage threshold will need actual implementation coverage to meet 80%
- E2E tests needed refinement for strict mode compliance
- TypeScript version warning in ESLint (cosmetic issue)

### Action Items
- Monitor coverage as more components are added
- Consider adding visual regression testing in future
- Update TypeScript/ESLint versions when compatible
